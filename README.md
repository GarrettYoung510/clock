## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on manipulating time in javascript

## Technologies Used
* Vanilla JS (string templating, time, date, setInterval)
* Date FNS (formatting date & time)
* Real DOM manipulation (innterHTML)
* Live Server VS Extension (testing)

## Challenges

* Testing and learning Date FNS, but it is always fun to learn something new
* Date FNS cdn not compatible with GitHub as it is not secure (HTTP instead of HTTPS)

## Next Steps

* Adding this to other projects so there is a date and time for people
